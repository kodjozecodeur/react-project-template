## 🛠 Tailwind Setup

Tailwind directives included in `src/index.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind configured in `tailwind.config.js` to scan:

```js
content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
```

## 🗺 Routing

Routing is managed with **React Router v6+** inside `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
```

Example:

```jsx
<Router>
  <Header />
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>
```
